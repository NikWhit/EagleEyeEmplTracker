## Description
This handy little Node app could be a great way for an HR team to keep track of their roster of people. Using MySQL the databases can be uploaded. 
Instructions for prepping MySQL with necessary data. 
mysql> use employee_db> source db/schema.sql> source seeds.sql> quit
I changed a few things up for originality. Instead of "Role", I used the term "Position", which postulated a very interesting find. The term "position" is actually a sql reserved term, so having to use `position` backticks is 100% necessary for some parts of the code. I kept it to prove the discovery, rather than reverting back to "role". I also changed "employee" to "hired", because the database was already called employee. I wanted to differentiate for my own sanity.

Also, Module 10 helped immensely with structure.
Helped a bit with structure, and to get an overall idea of how I would accomplish this. 
I learned a lot about inquirer and ESM and CommonJS during this exercise. 

Many of the requirements took me back to the class material of 10-OOP/01-Activities and 02-Challenge
